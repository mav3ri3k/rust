## Why Rust?

- **Performance:** Fast and memory-efficient, suitable for critical services, embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.

- **Reliability:** Our rich type system and ownership model ensure memory and thread safety, reducing bugs at compile-time.

- **Productivity:** Comprehensive documentation, a compiler committed to providing great diagnostics, and advanced tooling including package manager and build tool ([Cargo]), auto-formatter ([rustfmt]), linter ([Clippy]) and editor support ([rust-analyzer]).
